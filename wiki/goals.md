__Next Billion Users (NBUs)__
Empower developers to create SPAs for the NBUs of the web. The NBUs tend to use more affordable and less powerful devices. These devices struggle to achieve a two second Time to Interactive (TTI) with larger component libraries and frameworks.

__Practical__
Familiarity with other JavaScript component libraries. Components are instantiated objects which may be used to control their own state. Components have a simple markup language with a gradual learning curve.

__Generalized__
API as unopinionated as possible. Developers choose the right design patterns for their SPAsâ€”not the library.

__Fast__
High performance. Sling aims to get your SPA to interactive as quickly as possible and aims to keep your SPA as responsive as possible by staying within small code production budgets. With Sling, it should be easier for your SPA to run at 60 frames per second for a native application experience.

__Minimal Setup__
Simply import the Sling functions required by your SPA and Sling is ready to use. No configuration files and no hidden requirements.
