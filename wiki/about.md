Sling is a client-side JavaScript framework for building Single Page Applications (SPAs). Sling is lightweight, **8KB minified, and less than 3KB gzipped**.

Sling creates and uses an Incremental DOM to perform differential updates for fast rendering.

Sling has an automatic change detection mechanism which updates your components for you.

Sling is structured using ECMAScript modules so that Sling code is tree shakeable to ultimately reduce bundle sizes.

Sling is developed by Daniel Puckowski.
