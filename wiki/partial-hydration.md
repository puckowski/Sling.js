# Partial Hydration

Sling.js supports Partial Hydration, also known as the Islands Architecture. 

Sling.js can hydrate a portion of a page where interactivity is needed, where the remainder of the page can be rendered as pure HTML.

For an example of a server-side and client-side application implementing Partial Hydration, refer to the following links:
